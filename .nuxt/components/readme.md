# Discovered Components

This is an auto-generated list of components discovered by [nuxt/components](https://github.com/nuxt/components).

You can directly use them in pages and other components without the need to import them.

**Tip:** If a component is conditionally rendered with `v-if` and is big, it is better to use `Lazy` or `lazy-` prefix to lazy load.

- `<ColumnFreezedDataTable>` | `<column-freezed-data-table>` (components/columnFreezedDataTable.vue)
- `<ConfirmDialog>` | `<confirm-dialog>` (components/confirmDialog.vue)
- `<Toast>` | `<toast>` (components/toast.vue)
